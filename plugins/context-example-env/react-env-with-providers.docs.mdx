## Overview

Example of a customised React environment, with Preview providers configured to wrap all compositions of components built with this environment.

### Composition Providers

Inside the `.preview.runtime.ts` file in this component, you will see a `Providers` section. Components added here will be wrapped around all compositions that components using this 
environment expose, as a way to mimic the behaviour of consuming apps.  

For instance, your components may contain themable css, theming for which comes from the consuming app or 
component. You don't want to add that theme inside your component, but you do want to be able to create component examples and contexts (compositions) which will illustrate how that 
component will look when it is consumed by an app with a theme. 

One option is to simply add your theme component to all compositions, which is fine for a while but if you want to do that for all of your components this quickly becomes teidous.
Instead, you can add the theme to the Preview providers, and then it will be wrapped round all your components, as if the environment was the consuming app.

In this repo we've implemented an even more concrete example of provider that consuming apps will need to, well, Provide for components to function properly. 

### Context Providers

In react, [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) can be a powerful way of wirelessly connecting up parts of the app, state-management without the wires if you will.

The Provider, managing the data, and Consumer are two different components, so how do we connect them up? And how can we create examples of a Consumer without the Provider component
to inject the context.

The `movies-api-context` component here illustrates an example of building an api context which contains the logic for both Provider and Consumer (useMovieContext) functions. The Consumer
component will import `useMovieContext` to read the context, and the consuming app - in this case the Compositions feature in bit - will import the Provider and wrap the app with it.  

### Context singleton

Another thing to note when using context with bit, and specifically compositions, is that the Context connection requires both Provider and Consumer to be talking about the same 
instance of the Context component. Otherwise they won't actually be talking to each other. 

In a regular consuming app there will just be a single version of the `movie-context-api` component, which will conduct the context from Provider to Consumer. However, when talking about 
two orthogonal components in the bit cloud being brought together by a composition, there is no containing application per se. In this case, both the environment (for Provider) and the 
individual consumer components import the `movies-api-context` component, separately, so how do they know how to talk to each other? 

The solution for this is for is a setting, again in the bit environment, which tells all components to take the context component from an agree-upon location.

This setting is called `resolveFromEnv` - see the `react.overrideDependencies` line in the `main.runtime.ts` file here for an example usage.

### Usage instructions

Create a **variant** in project's `workspace.jsonc` file.  
Set this extension as the variant's environment, for instance for the variant "any components in the 'ui' namespace":

```json
{
   "teambit.workspace/variants": {
     "{ui/**}": {
       "`learn-bit-react.movies/extensions/react-env-with-provider`": {}
     }
   }
}
```
